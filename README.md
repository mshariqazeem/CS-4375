# CS-4375
This is a repository for class CS 4375: Introduction to Machine Learning

## Assignment 0 - Getting Started
**Description:** In this assignment, I gave an overview of ML.<br>
Click [here](Overview_of_ML.pdf) to see the document.

## Assignment 1 - Data Exploration
**Description:** In this assignment, I used multiple functions to explore different statistical measures about the given data.<br> 
Click [here](Source.cpp) to look at the code.<br>
Click [here](Data_Exploration.pdf) to see the discussion about those measures.

## Assignment 2 - Linear Models
**Description:** In this assignment, I created Regression and Classification models on two different data sets and evaluated the results with the actual values.<br>
Click [here](Regression.pdf) to look at the Linear Regresion document.<br>
Click [here](Classification.pdf) to look at the Logistic Regresion and Naive Bayes document.

## Assignment 3 - ML from Scratch
**Description:** In this assignment, I created two C++ Programs.<br>
First Program performs Logistic Regression on the titanic data set.<br>
Second Program performs Naive Bayes on the titanic data set.<br>
Click [here](LogisticRegression.cpp) to look at the first program.<br>
Click [here](NaiveBayes.cpp) to look at the second program.<br>
Click [here](ML_from_Scratch_Report.pdf) to look at a document discussing both models and other aspects of Machine Learning.

## Assignment 4 - Similarity
**Description:** In this assignment, my group members and I created four notebooks, exploring different linear models, similarity algorithms, and clustering methods.<br>
Click [here](Similarity_Reduction.pdf) to look at the Regression Notebook.<br>
Click [here](Classification2.pdf) to look at the Classification Notebook.<br>
Click [here](Clustering.pdf) to look at the Clustering Notebook.<br>
Click [here](Dimensionality_Reduction.pdf) to look at the Dimensionality Reduction Notebook.

## Assignment 5 - Kernel and Ensemble Methods
**Description:** In this assignment, we created 3 notebooks and a narrative document which discusses the algorithms used in the notebooks. Notebook 1 explores SVM for Regression; Notebook 2 explores SVM for Classification. Notebook 3 explores different ensemble methods.<br>
Click [here](Regression2.pdf) to look at the Notebook 1.<br>
Click [here](Classification3.pdf) to look at the Notebook 2.<br>
Click [here](Ensemble_Techniques.pdf) to look at the Notebook 3.<br>
Click [here](Kernel_and_Ensemble_Metthods.pdf) to look at the Narrative document.<br>

## Assignment 6 - ML with sklearn
**Description:** In this assignment, I explored sklearn libraries to perform logistic regression, decision tree, and neural network on the given data set.<br>
Click [here](Sklearn.pdf) to look at the sklearn document.<br>
Click [here](Auto.csv) to look at the data.<br>
