# CS-4375
This is a repository for class CS 4375: Introduction to Machine Learning

## Assignment 0 - Getting Started
**Description:** In this assignment, I gave an overview of ML.<br>
Click [here](Overview_of_ML.pdf) to see the document.

## Assignment 1 - Data Exploration
**Description:** In this assignment, I used multiple functions to explore different statistical measures about the given data.<br> 
Click [here](Source.cpp) to look at the code.<br>
Click [here](Data_Exploration.pdf) to see the discussion about those measures.

## Assignment 2 - Linear Models
**Description:** In this assignment, I created Regression and Classification models on two different data sets and evaluated the results with the actual values.<br>
Click [here](Regression.pdf) to look at the Linear Regresion document.<br>
Click [here](Classification.pdf) to look at the Logistic Regresion and Naive Bayes document.

## Assignment 3 - ML from Scratch
**Description:** In this assignment, I created two C++ Programs.<br>
First Program performs Logistic Regression on the titanic data set.<br>
Second Program performs Naive Bayes on the titanic data set.<br>
Click [here](LogisticRegression.cpp) to look at the first program.<br>
Click [here](NaiveBayes.cpp) to look at the seconf program.<br>
Click [here](ML_from_Scratch_Report.pdf) to look at a document discussing both models and other aspects of Machine Learning.
